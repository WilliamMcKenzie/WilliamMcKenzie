## Hi there 👋

My name is William and I'm a first year Math student at Waterloo. My main interests are

- (Scalable) multiplayer game systems
- Procedural generation
- Anything Go related

Kingdom Crushers is open source now so feel free to make a hacked client

Check out my procedural projects [here!](https://www.williamqm.com/gallery)

I publish my coolest projects [here](https://github.com/studio-imperium)
